This project demonstrates essential concepts of state management in React, focusing on the use of the useState hook for managing form inputs and conditional rendering. 

## Overview

This project includes:

- *Introduction to State and Hooks*: Using React's useState hook for managing state in functional components.
- *Component State Management*: How state changes affect component rendering.
- *Conditional Rendering*: Displaying content conditionally based on the component state.

## Practice Exercise

As part of this assignment, we built a simple form that captures user input through controlled components. The form demonstrates how to manage component state and display content dynamically based on state changes.

## Features

- *React Functional Components*: Built using React functional components to leverage hooks for state management.
- *State Management*: Utilizes useState to handle form inputs, providing a clear, controlled way to update and manage form data.
- *Conditional Rendering*: Shows or hides content based on form state and input validation.

## Technologies Used

- *React*: For building the user interface.
- *JavaScript (ES6)*: Leveraging modern JavaScript features for cleaner code.
- *React Hooks (useState)*: Managing state within functional components.
